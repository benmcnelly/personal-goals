# Personal Goals

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

## Overarching Goals

1. :muscle: [Be healthy](goals/health.md)
1. :chart_with_upwards_trend: Spend money wisely and save :dollar:
1. :black_nib: Write more
1. :speech_balloon: More friend time
1. :guitar: Learn Ukulele
