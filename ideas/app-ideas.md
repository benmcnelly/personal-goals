# App & Project Ideas

## Side Projects

- :basketball: IsTheLeadSafe.com 
  + [ ] Port to Django
  + [ ] Update React to latest
  + [ ] Release React-Native app
  + [ ] Redesign
  + [ ] Update to use channels
  + [ ] Add instant status

- :basketball: Bracket App: With React Native, the barrier for creating a good bracket app is possible. [Simple Bracket](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/simple-bracket/posts/772777) is the best iPhone brakcet app that I have ever used. I'd love to make a modern updated version with a decent web app.

- DjangoCon Yearbook
  + [x] Scraper for US websites
  + [ ] Build models

- Finish Trello Python tools
  + [ ] Trolley <--> Buffer :trolleybus:
  + [ ] Meeting tool

- Finish Scraper Proxy service

- Opinionated Pinboard link updater
  + [x] Initial version
  + [x] Launch on my shared server

- TV Theories: General purpose tracking website for TV shows. Structured mix of Wikipedia information with comments and theories (unlike Reddit)
  + [x] Wikipedia scraper
  + [x] Wikia scraper
  + [x] Polymorphic models (Topics)
  + [x] Topic discovery
  + [ ] Better tools for sharing / validating theories
  + [ ] Open source it?
  + [ ] Support for multiple TV Series
  + [ ] Timeline support syncing mixed media types (series, movies, comics, etc)

- Flask Process wrapper: Takes an existing web app or process and wraps a reverse proxy and webapi with some light process isolation with it. All stdout + stderr messages are accessible via websockets. The app will install the processes into a virtualenv and has hooks for updating the application, restarting the application, running migrations, updating the dapp, and for spawning more processes. This builds a REST API around common web processes.

- Better Gmail Rules: A combination of a simple Django app (Contacts + Groups) and scanning email with imapy then building custom import rules to export back to gmail.
