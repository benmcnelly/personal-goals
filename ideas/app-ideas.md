- Flask Process wrapper: Takes an existing web app or process and wraps a reverse proxy and webapi with some light process isolation with it. All stdout + stderr messages are accessible via websockets. The app will install the processes into a virtualenv and has hooks for updating the application, restarting the application, running migrations, updating the dapp, and for spawning more processes. This builds a REST API around common web processes.

- Better Gmail Rules: A combination of a simple Django app (Contacts + Groups) and scanning email with imapy then building custom import rules to export back to gmail.
