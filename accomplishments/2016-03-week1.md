## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

It was a great week for basketball. KU Won the season out and took home both the Big-12 Championship and the Big-12 Tourneyment Championship Title. It turned out to be a great year with the NCAA Tournament starting this week. :basketball:

DCUS planning is going well and we are so close to having everything opened up and ready to go. The last year and a half has really pushed me to develop more patience than I realized I had previously. At the end of the day, it'll be worth it. Most of the tasks I didn't get done were because my calendar was messed up and I had my weeks messed up.

I had to completely destroy and then rebuild my iCal this week. After meeting start days and times were getting messed up and meetings were showing up a week early. If you know me well enough, you'll know that my life is ruled by calendar. When it's flaked out, my life is chaos.
